# Changelog

All notable changes to `tine-storage` are recorded here. The crate's semantic
version describes its Rust API; persistent byte formats are versioned
independently in `src/formats.rs` and summarized in
`FORMAT-COMPATIBILITY.md`.

## [Unreleased]

## [0.6.3] - 2026-08-14

### Added

- The certified managed-storage layout now names the content-addressed lazy
  genesis archive and its manifest, commit, catalog-update, and segment files.
  This is the physical publication vocabulary for Tine's new activation
  format; authority and semantic validation remain owned by Tine core.

## [0.6.2] - 2026-08-14

### Fixed

- Private Patricia construction now divides a sorted update range larger than
  one resident bulk sink into consecutive canonical bulk publications. Dense
  reference indices no longer fall back to hundreds of thousands of loose
  per-key immutable files merely because the complete range exceeds one
  bounded construction buffer.
- Packed Patricia catalogs admit up to 128 MiB of exact immutable pack data.
  This remains a hard decode and construction bound, while covering the
  derived reverse-reference index of a representative 130,000-block graph
  without forcing the otherwise valid tail into loose per-node files.

## [0.6.1] - 2026-08-13

### Added

- Regime-neutral graph-projection changes can transactionally replace the
  parser-derived aliases owned by each replaced page. Replacement, deletion,
  and reopen now leave no stale alias declarations in the disposable SQLite
  projection.
- The complete managed-storage path vocabulary is now exported through the
  certified format manifest and pinned to the exact pre-migration Tine values.
  This changes ownership and reviewability only; no persisted path changes.

## [0.6.0] - 2026-08-13

### Added

- Regime-neutral graph-projection changes can transactionally replace the raw
  page-reference spellings owned by each replaced page. Direct Files can now
  populate the same disposable `reference_postings` facts and bounded
  navigation-name read used by managed storage, without a second application
  cache or a whole-graph referenced-name scan.
- Disposable projections now maintain a SQLite trigram index and expose
  bounded page candidates for exact normalized literal-substring matching,
  including matches in the middle of tokens. One- and two-character needles
  use the bounded page inventory; the application parser remains the final
  semantic matcher for every query.
- Disposable projections expose bounded page candidates for Unicode-normalized
  ordered-subsequence fuzzy matching. This is a candidate superset: the
  application parser remains the final owner of fuzzy semantics and ordering.

### Changed

- The disposable SQLite projection schema is now 16. Older projections rebuild
  from authoritative graph/history input rather than being reinterpreted.

## [0.5.0] - 2026-08-13

### Added

- Disposable SQLite projections can return bounded task-candidate structural
  locators without copying block content or public UUIDs. Applications that
  already retain the exact parser document can recover and identity-check the
  corresponding parser block while managed storage keeps the existing full-row
  physical API.
- Standalone disposable projections can transactionally retain each page's
  caller-owned source revision and report only changed, missing, or deleted
  pages on reopen. Direct Files can therefore reuse exact SQLite facts after a
  clean restart and lower only externally changed parser documents; these
  revisions are adapter metadata and do not alter managed-storage formats.

### Fixed

- A refused legacy-journal recovery scan now explicitly releases its retained
  writer lock before returning, so an immediate retry reports the original
  corruption instead of an intermittent false “already open” refusal.

## [0.4.0] - 2026-08-13

### Added

- A regime-neutral disposable SQLite graph projection with one typed page
  replace/delete transaction and the existing bounded page, block, task,
  property, reference, and search reads. Direct Files and managed storage can
  now feed the same physical graph-fact tables without exposing an oplog
  frontier or raw SQLite connection to Direct Files.

### Changed

- Managed materialization delegates its graph-row work to the same extracted
  projection engine while retaining accepted-frontier stamps and reference
  authentication in its managed-only adapter. The on-disk managed format is
  unchanged.

## [0.3.1] - 2026-08-13

### Fixed

- Android immutable bootstrap batches now fall back from unavailable
  filesystem-wide synchronization to exact per-file synchronization, while
  retaining strict failure for ordinary I/O errors.

## [0.3.0] - 2026-08-10

### Added

- Bounded SQLite reads for exact-marker task-candidate blocks and block-only
  structure. Candidate pagination seeks by `(page_id, block_id)` and returns
  only the raw block/page fields needed for application-owned parsing;
  structural point reads exclude content, search text, and public UUIDs.

## [0.2.0] - 2026-08-10

### Added

- Local-journal protocol v2 with a checksummed segment identity and an ordered,
  separately durable frontier. A returned append is selected exactly once;
  an unreturned physical suffix is discarded on reopen without weakening a
  previously committed frontier.
- A typed durable-directory publication API for exact create, replacement, and
  authority retirement. Windows proves the capability in an owned namespace
  and uses `MoveFileExW` write-through publication with exact byte and file
  identity verification.

### Changed

- Legacy v1 journal rollover now inspects ambiguous suffixes without mutating
  them before a migration decision.
- The ordinary Patricia certification suite separates a 4,096-record semantic
  differential from a 96-record physical publish/reopen proof; the complete
  4,096-record physical journey remains a required release burn-in.
- The Rust API intentionally adds variants to exhaustive storage and journal
  error enums. This requires the `0.2.0` compatibility boundary.

## [0.1.1] - 2026-08-10

### Fixed

- Local-journal recovery now preserves the segment and fails closed when a
  fully sized final frame fails validation or a damaged length field makes its
  extent beyond EOF ambiguous. Only a byte tail too short to contain any
  complete frame is truncated, preventing corruption from silently discarding
  a previously durable commit.

## [0.1.0] - 2026-08-10

### Added

- Exact immutable filesystem publication with no-follow and durability checks.
- Durable batch codecs, local journal recovery, scratch storage, and packed
  authenticated Patricia indices.
- Disposable SQLite frontier and graph materialization behind a typed facade.
- Generated public-API inventory and a production/test-support boundary gate.
- Machine-readable persistent-format manifest.
